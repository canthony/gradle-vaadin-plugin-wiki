## Getting started on the console

The easiest and most powerful way to use Gradle is from the console.  This also is true for using the Gradle Vaadin Plugin. 

## Installing Gradle on the system

If you are starting from scratch with Gradle you will first need to install Gradle on your system. How you do this depends on your operating system.

### Linux
On Linux Gradle can already be found under most package managers. However, many times the version of Gradle that is distributed via the default repositories are usually quite old and might not work with the Gradle Vaadin Plugin.

If you are on **Ubuntu** there is an excellent ppa available that will always provide you with the newest version of Gradle. You can install it using the following commands:
```
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gradle
```

For other distributions the safest way is to download the distributable directly from gradle.org and put in the the PATH of your system. The latest release can always be found at https://gradle.org/gradle-download/

### Windows
There is not installer for Gradle on Windows so you will have to download the Gradle distribution from https://gradle.org/gradle-download/ and put Gradle on your PATH. 

A very good tutorial on how to do that can be found at http://www.bryanlor.com/blog/gradle-tutorial-how-install-gradle-windows

### OSX

On OSX you can use homebrew to install Gradle, in your console execute
```
 brew install gradle
```

However, the version available via homebrew might be old, so if you want to update to the latest version you can use the good instructions over at http://ondrej-kvasnovsky.blogspot.fi/2012/05/how-to-install-gradle-on-mac-os.html.

## Creating a Vaadin Gradle Project

To create a new project create a new folder wher you want the project to be located.

```console
mkdir HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
```


To make the folder a Gradle project it needs to contain a **build.gradle** file, so create that next with the following content:

```gradle
// Tell Gradle to add Vaadin support
plugins {
  id 'fi.jasoft.plugin.vaadin' version '1.0'
}
```
 
As you see the only content we need to have in that file is the Gradle Vaadin Plugin definition.

But the project is not complete yet, it is still missing the correct folder structures and files. To help with initializing the project, the Gradle Vaadin Plugin provides the **vaadinCreateProject** task. Lets run it by executing the following in our project folder:

```console
gradle vaadinCreateProject
``` 

This will create the following project structure :
```
.
├── build.gradle
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   └── com
        │       └── example
        │           └── helloworld
        │               ├── HelloWorldServlet.java
        │               └── HelloWorldUI.java
        ├── resources
        │   └── META-INF
        │       └── beans.xml
        └── webapp
            └── VAADIN
                └── themes
                    └── HelloWorld
                        ├── addons.scss
                        ├── favicon.ico 
                        ├── helloworld.scss
                        └── styles.scss
```

The plugin will create  an example Vaadin UI along with a servlet that serves the UI. It will also automatically add a project theme that inherits the built in Valo theme. The beans.xml is there if you are going to use bean discovery in your project. More about that in  [[Using CDI/EJB]]. 

## Running the project

To run the project the Gradle Vaadin Plugin provides the **vaadinRun** task. Execute the following to deploy the project on a development server running locally:

```console
gradle vaadinRun
```

Once the server has started a new browser window will be opened with your application.

To stop the server, press ``Ctrl+C`` to terminate the gradle process.
