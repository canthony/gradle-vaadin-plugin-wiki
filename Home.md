# Gradle Vaadin Plugin

The Vaadin Gradle plugin allows you to easily build Vaadin projects with Gradle. It helps with the most tedious tasks when building a Vaadin project like building the widgetset and running development mode. It also helps you to quickly get started by providing tasks for project, component and theme creation.
