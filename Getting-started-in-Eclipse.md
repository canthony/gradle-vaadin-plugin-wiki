### Installing Gradle support in Eclipse
As of writing the Eclipse Gradle support is only bundled with the Java, Committer and RAP/RCP distributions of Eclipse Neon which means that if you are a Vaadin developer you most likely have the Java EE version and will need to manually install the Gradle support. Hopefully this will change in the future.

To install the Gradle support in Eclipse we need to install a eclipse plugin called Gradle BuildShip which is the official Gradle support provided by the Eclipse Foundation. We can do that from the Eclipse Marketplace by searching for “buildship” and pressing install.
